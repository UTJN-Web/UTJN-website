# Public Form Access Implementation

This document describes the implementation of public form access functionality for the UTJN website, allowing users to access and complete forms via QR codes without requiring login.

## 🎯 Overview

The implementation enables team members to show QR codes at events, allowing attendees to:
1. Scan the QR code with their phone
2. Access the form directly without logging in
3. Complete the form as a guest or logged-in user
4. Receive discount coupons for future events

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema Changes
- Added `accessToken` field to `Form` table (unique identifier for public access)
- Added `allowPublicAccess` field to `Form` table (toggle for public accessibility)
- Created indexes for performance optimization

### API Endpoints

#### Frontend (Next.js)
- `GET /api/forms/[token]` - Get form by access token
- `POST /api/forms/[token]/submit` - Submit form via access token
- `GET /api/forms/[id]/qr` - Get QR code data for form

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- `GET /forms/public/{access_token}` - Get form and event data by token
- `POST /forms/public/{access_token}/submit` - Submit form with guest user support
- `GET /forms/{form_id}/qr` - Generate QR code data

### Frontend Routes
- `/form/[token]` - Public form access page
- `/test-forms` - Testing dashboard
- `/admin/forms` - Admin panel with QR code generation

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Unique Access Tokens
- Each form gets a cryptographically secure access token
- Format: `form_{32-character-urlsafe-string}`
- Used to create unique URLs like `/form/form_abc123...`

### 2. QR Code Generation
- QR codes generated in admin panel
- Contains direct link to public form
- Downloadable for sharing
- Uses external API service for QR generation

### 3. Guest User Support
- Users can complete forms without accounts
- System creates guest user entries automatically
- Guest users identified by email and name
- Prevents duplicate entries by email

### 4. Optional Login
- Public form page includes login option
- Existing users can login for better experience
- Preserves user associations for analytics

### 5. Automatic Coupon Generation
- Forms can trigger automatic coupon creation
- Based on number of submissions
- Individual coupons generated per user
- Configurable discount amounts and types

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
Run the migration script to update existing forms:
```bash
cd scripts
python migrate_forms.py
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to your environment:
```env
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Or your production domain
```

### 3. Deploy Changes
1. Deploy backend changes (FastAPI)
2. Deploy frontend changes (Next.js)
3. Ensure database connection works

## 📱 User Flow

### Admin Flow
1. Admin creates form in `/admin/forms`
2. Form gets unique access token automatically
3. Admin clicks QR code button in form list
4. QR code modal displays with:
   - QR code image
   - Public URL
   - Download and copy options
5. Admin shares QR code at events

### User Flow
1. User scans QR code with phone
2. Opens `/form/{token}` page
3. Sees event and form information
4. Chooses to login or continue as guest
5. Fills out form fields
6. Submits form
7. Receives confirmation with any generated coupons
8. Can save coupon codes for future use

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Forms are only accessible if `allowPublicAccess` is true
- Access tokens are cryptographically secure
- Guest users are sandboxed from main user system

### Data Protection
- Guest user data stored securely
- No sensitive information exposed in URLs
- Form submissions linked to proper user accounts

### Rate Limiting
- Consider implementing rate limiting on public endpoints
- Prevent spam submissions
- Monitor for abuse patterns

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Page
Visit `/test-forms` to see:
- Demo QR codes for existing events
- Public URLs for testing
- Feature overview and status

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create an event in admin panel
2. Create a form for the event
3. Generate QR code in admin panel
4. Open public form URL
5. Complete form as guest user
6. Verify coupon generation
7. Test login flow

### Automated Testing
Consider adding tests for:
- Token generation uniqueness
- Public form access
- Guest user creation
- Coupon generation logic
